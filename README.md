To install:
1. Clone repo
2. Navigate to the directory in Terminal and run `npm install` to install all dependencies
3. Run `touch .env` to create a `.env` file. This file will store all API keys and other variables, and is excluded from our Git repository so others don't access our keys.
4. Ask Mathew for the keys to add to your .env file
